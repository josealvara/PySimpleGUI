# ELEMENT AND FUNCTION CALL REFERENCE

Here you will find the details for all Elements, Objects, and Functions that are available to you.  If you want to use a complex element and don't understand the parameters, then this is the right place to come.  For every element you're shown the parameters used to create it as well as all methods available to call.

## Currently PySimpleGUI (tkinter) only

This documentation is created using the PySimpleGUI.py file which means it's based on the tkinter code. Some of the calls are different, might not exist at all, or there may be more methods/functions for the other PySimpleGUI ports (Qt, Wx, Web).  

Work is underway to get the PySimpleGUIQt docstrings completed and corrected.

## Caution - Some functions / methods may be internal only yet exposed in this documentation

This section of the documentation is generated directly from the source code.  As a result, sometimes internal only functions or methods that you are not supposed to be calling are accidently shown in this documentation.  Hopefully these accidents don't happen often.

Here are all of the Elements, the Window & SystemTray classes, and all functions

---------

## Button Element 

    Button Element - Defines all possible buttons. The shortcuts such as Submit, FileBrowse, ... each create a Button

```
Button(button_text = "",
    button_type = 7,
    target = (None, None),
    tooltip = None,
    file_types = (('ALL Files', '*.*'),),
    initial_folder = None,
    default_extension = "",
    disabled = False,
    change_submits = False,
    enable_events = False,
    image_filename = None,
    image_data = None,
    image_size = (None, None),
    image_subsample = None,
    border_width = None,
    size = (None, None),
    s = (None, None),
    auto_size_button = None,
    button_color = None,

You CAN click on the element and utilize it.

```
block_focus(block = True)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|

        Note that it will re-appear at the bottom of the window / container, most likely.

```python
unhide_row()
```

## Graph Element 

    Creates an area for you to draw on.  The MAGICAL property this Element has is that you interact
    with the element using your own coordinate system.  This is an important point!!  YOU define where the location
    is for (0,0).  Want (0,0) to be in the middle of the graph like a math 4-quadrant graph?  No problem!  Set your
    lower left corner to be (-100,-100) and your upper right to be (100,100) and you've got yourself a graph with
    (0,0) at the center.
    One of THE coolest of the Elements.
    You can also use float values. To do so, be sure and set the float_values parameter.
    Mouse click and drag events are possible and return the (x,y) coordinates of the mouse
    Drawing primitives return an "id" that is referenced when you want to operation on that item (e.g. to erase it)

## Menu Element 

    Menu Element is the Element that provides a Menu Bar that goes across the top of the window, just below titlebar.
    Here is an example layout.  The "&" are shortcut keys ALT+key.
    Is a List of -  "Item String" + List
    Where Item String is what will be displayed on the Menubar itself.
    The List that follows the item represents the items that are shown then Menu item is clicked
    Notice how an "entry" in a mennu can be a list which means it branches out and shows another menu, etc. (resursive)
    menu_def = [['&File', ['!&Open', '&Save::savekey', '---', '&Properties', 'E&xit']],
                ['!&Edit', ['!&Paste', ['Special', 'Normal', ], 'Undo'], ],
                ['&Debugger', ['Popout', 'Launch Debugger']],
                ['&Toolbar', ['Command &1', 'Command &2', 'Command &3', 'Command &4']],
                ['&Help', '&About...'], ]
    Finally, "keys" can be added to entries so make them unique.  The "Save" entry has a key associated with it. You
    can see it has a "::" which signifies the beginning of a key.  The user will not see the key portion when the
    menu is shown.  The key portion is returned as part of the event.

"Cursor" is used in 2 different ways in this call.
For the parameter "cursor" it's actually the mouse pointer.
If you do not want any mouse pointer, then use the string "none"
For the parameter "cursor_color" it's the color of the beam used when typing into an input element

## MenubarCustom Element

Note that while the MenubarCustom is an element, it is implemented using a function.
It is actually a "compound element" that consists of several elements combined into a single Column element.
See the Column element to get a list of method calls available.  The function returns a Column element.

A custom Menubar that replaces the OS provided Menubar

Why?
Two reasons - 1. they look great (see custom titlebar) 2. if you have a custom titlebar, then you have to use a custom menubar if you want a menubar

```
MenubarCustom(menu_definition,
    disabled_text_color = None,
    bar_font = None,
    font = None,
    tearoff = False,
    pad = None,
    background_color = None,

### grab_anywhere_exclude

Excludes this element from being used by the grab_anywhere feature

```python
grab_anywhere_exclude()
```

### grab_anywhere_include

        This will allow you to make a Multline element drag a window for example

```python
grab_anywhere_include()
```

### hide_row

Hide the entire row an Element is located on.
        Use this if you must have all space removed when you are hiding an element, including the row container

```python
hide_row()
```

### print

Print like Python normally prints except route the output to a multiline element and also add colors if desired

colors -(str, str) or str.  A combined text/background color definition in a single parameter

There are also "aliases" for text_color, background_color and colors (t, b, c)
t - An alias for color of the text (makes for shorter calls)
b - An alias for the background_color parameter
c - (str, str) - "shorthand" way of specifying color. (foreground, backgrouned)
c - str - can also be a string of the format "foreground on background"  ("white on red")

With the aliases it's possible to write the same print but in more compact ways:
cprint('This will print white text on red background', c=('white', 'red'))
cprint('This will print white text on red background', c='white on red')
cprint('This will print white text on red background', text_color='white', background_color='red')
cprint('This will print white text on red background', t='white', b='red')

```
print(args=*<1 or N object>,
    end = None,
    sep = None,
    text_color = None,
    background_color = None,

## Titlebar Element

Note that while the Titlebar is an element, it is implemented using a function.
It is actually a "compound element" that consists of several elements combined into a single Column element.
See the Column element to get a list of method calls available.  The function returns a Column element.

A custom titlebar that replaces the OS provided titlebar, thus giving you control
the is not possible using the OS provided titlebar such as the color.

NOTE LINUX USERS - at the moment the minimize function is not yet working.  Windows users
should have no problem and it should function as a normal window would.

This titlebar is created from a row of elements that is then encapulated into a
single Column element which is what the Titlebar returns to you.

A custom titlebar removes the margins from your window.  Ify ou want the  remainder
of your Window to have margins, place the layout after the Titlebar into a Column and
set the pad of that Column to the dimensions you would like your margins to have.

The Titlebar is a COLUMN element.  You can thus call the update method for the column and
perform operations such as making the column visible/invisible

```
Titlebar(title = "",
    icon = None,
    text_color = None,
    background_color = None,
    font = None,
    key = None,
    k = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|       str or bytes or None        |       icon       | Can be either a filename or Base64 value. For Windows if filename, it MUST be ICO format. For Linux, must NOT be ICO |
|                str                |      title       | The "title" to show in the titlebar |
|            str or None            |    text_color    | Text color for titlebar |
|            str or None            | background_color | Background color for titlebar |
|            str or None            |       font       | Font to be used for the text and the symbols |
| str or int or tuple or object or None |       key        | Identifies an Element. Should be UNIQUE to this window. |
| str or int or tuple or object or None |        k         | Exactly the same as key. Choose one of them to use |
| Column | **RETURN** | A single Column element that has eveything in 1 element

Deltes the filename and path for your settings file.  Either paramter can be optional.
If you don't choose a path, one is provided for you that is OS specific
Windows path default = users/name/AppData/Local/PySimpleGUI/settings.
If you don't choose a filename, your application's filename + '.json' will be used
Also sets your current dictionary to a blank one.

```
delete_file(filename = None, path = None)
```

| (str or None) |   path   | The folder that the settings file will be stored in. Do not include the filename. |

### get

Returns the value of a specified setting.  If the setting is not found in the settings dictionary, then
the user specified default value will be returned.  It no default is specified and nothing is found, then
the "default value" is returned.  This default can be specified in this call, or previously defined
by calling set_default. If nothing specified now or previously, then None is returned as default.

```
get(key, default = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| Any |   key   | Key used to lookup the setting in the settings dictionary |

settings, a default one will be used and then read.

Note that you can display the dictionary in text format by printing the object itself.

`get_dict()`

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Dict| **return** | The current settings dictionary |

### get_filename

Sets the filename and path for your settings file.  Either paramter can be optional.

If you don't choose a path, one is provided for you that is OS specific
Windows path default = users/name/AppData/Local/PySimpleGUI/settings.

If you don't choose a filename, your application's filename + '.json' will be used.

Normally the filename and path are split in the user_settings calls. However for this call they
can be combined so that the filename contains both the path and filename.

The filename can be a full filename including a path, or the path can be specified separately.
If  no filename is specified, then the caller's filename will be used with the extension ".json"

```
load(filename = None, path = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (str or None) | filename | Filename to load settings from (and save to in the future) |

```
save(filename = None, path = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (str or None) | filename | The fFilename to save to. Can specify a path or just the filename. If no filename specified, then the caller's filename will be used. |
| (str or None) |   path   | The (optional) path to use to save the file. |
| (str) | **RETURN** | The full path and filename used to save the settings

### set

### add_row

Adds a single row of elements to a window's self.Rows variables.
Generally speaking this is NOT how users should be building Window layouts.
Users, create a single layout (a list of lists) and pass as a parameter to Window object, or call Window.Layout(layout)

```
add_row(args=*<1 or N object>)
```

### add_rows

Loops through a list of lists of elements and adds each row, list, to the layout.
This is NOT the best way to go about creating a window.  Sending the entire layout at one time and passing
it as a parameter to the Window call is better.

```
add_rows(rows)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| List[List[Elements]] | rows | A list of a list of elements |

### alpha_channel

#### property: alpha_channel

A property that changes the current alpha channel value (internal value)

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|

The tkinter specific data is in the Window's member variable user_bind_event

```
bind(bind_string, key)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|            str             | bind_string | The string tkinter expected in its bind function |
| str or int or tuple or object |     key     | The event that will be generated when the tkinter event occurs |

### bring_to_front

Brings this window to the top of all other windows (perhaps may not be brought before a window made to "stay
        on top")

```python
bring_to_front()
```

### close

Closes window.  Users can safely call even if window has been destroyed.   Should always call when done with
        a window so that resources are properly freed up within your thread.

```python
close()
```

### current_location

Get the current location of the window's top left corner

`current_location()`

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Tuple[(int), (int)]| **return** | The x and y location in tuple form (x,y) |

### ding

Make a "bell" sound. A capability provided by tkinter.  Your window needs to be finalized prior to calling.
Ring a display's bell is the tkinter description of the call.

```
ding(display_number = 0)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| int | display_number | Passed to tkinter's bell method as parameter "displayof". |

### disable

```python
disable()
```

### disable_debugger

Disable the internal debugger. By default the debugger is ENABLED

```python
disable_debugger()
```

### disappear

Causes a window to "disappear" from the screen, but remain on the taskbar. It does this by turning the alpha
        channel to 0.  NOTE that on some platforms alpha is not supported. The window will remain showing on these
        platforms.  The Raspberry Pi for example does not have an alpha setting

```python
disappear()
```

### elem

### element

Lots of action!

`finalize()`

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|(Window)| **return** | Returns 'self' so that method "Chaining" can happen (read up about it as it's very cool!) |

### find

### find_element

You can drop the entire "FindElement" function name and use [ ] instead.

Typically used in combination with a call to element's Update method (or any other element method!):
window[key].Update(new_value)

Versus the "old way"
window.FindElement(key).Update(new_value)

This call can be abbreviated to any of these:
FindElement == Element == Find

```python
make_modal()
```

### maximize

### refresh

Refreshes the window by calling tkroot.update().  Can sometimes get away with a refresh instead of a Read.
Use this call when you want something to appear in your Window immediately (as soon as this function is called).
Without this call your changes to a Window will not be visible to the user until the next Read call

`refresh()`

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|---|---|---|

### These are non-PEP8 Compliant Methods - do NOT use

***Do not use these***... they are here for your reference should you see them in old code.

The following methods are here for backwards compatibility reference.  You will find there are PEP8 versions for each of these methods.  The PEP8 versions will be all lower case and have underscores.

### AddRow

Adds a single row of elements to a window's self.Rows variables.
Generally speaking this is NOT how users should be building Window layouts.
Users, create a single layout (a list of lists) and pass as a parameter to Window object, or call Window.Layout(layout)

```
AddRow(args=*<1 or N object>)
```

### AddRows

Loops through a list of lists of elements and adds each row, list, to the layout.
This is NOT the best way to go about creating a window.  Sending the entire layout at one time and passing
it as a parameter to the Window call is better.

```
AddRows(rows)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| List[List[Elements]] | rows | A list of a list of elements |

### AlphaChannel

#### property: AlphaChannel

## Function Reference

These are the functions available for you to call

## Version Info

Returns a human-readable string of version numbers for:

Python version
PySimpleGUI Port (tkinter in this case)
tkinter version
PySimpleGUI version
The location of the PySimpleGUI.py file

The format is a newline between each value and descriptive text for each line

```
get_versions()
```

## Multi-window Interface

Reads all windows that are "active" when the call is made. "Active" means that it's been finalized or read.
If a window has not been finalized then it will not be considered an "active window"

If any of the active windows returns a value then the window and its event and values
are returned.

If no windows are open, then the value (None, WIN_CLOSED, None) will be returned
Since WIN_CLOSED is None, it means (None, None, None) is what's returned when no windows remain opened

```
read_all_windows(timeout = None, timeout_key = "__TIMEOUT__")
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| int |   timeout   | Time in milliseconds to delay before a returning a timeout event |
| Any | timeout_key | Key to return when a timeout happens. Defaults to the standard TIMEOUT_KEY |
| Tuple[Window, Any, (Dict or List)] | **RETURN** | A tuple with the  (Window, event, values dictionary/list)

## Debug Window Output

Works like a "print" statement but with windowing options.  Routes output to the "Debug Window"

In addition to the normal text and background colors, you can use a "colors" tuple/string
The "colors" or "c" parameter defines both the text and background in a single parm.
It can be a tuple or a single single. Both text and background colors need to be specified
colors -(str, str) or str.  A combined text/background color definition in a single parameter
c - (str, str) - Colors tuple has format (foreground, backgrouned)
c - str - can also be a string of the format "foreground on background"  ("white on red")

Works like a "print" statement but with windowing options.  Routes output to the "Debug Window"

In addition to the normal text and background colors, you can use a "colors" tuple/string
The "colors" or "c" parameter defines both the text and background in a single parm.
It can be a tuple or a single single. Both text and background colors need to be specified
colors -(str, str) or str.  A combined text/background color definition in a single parameter
c - (str, str) - Colors tuple has format (foreground, backgrouned)
c - str - can also be a string of the format "foreground on background"  ("white on red")

```

## Color Printing to Multiline Element of a Window

Color print to a multiline element in a window of your choice.
Must have EITHER called cprint_set_output_destination prior to making this call so that the
window and element key can be saved and used here to route the output, OR used the window
and key parameters to the cprint function to specicy these items.

args is a variable number of things you want to print.

end - The end char to use just like print uses
sep - The separation character like print uses
text_color - The color of the text
key - overrides the previously defined Multiline key
window - overrides the previously defined window to output to
background_color - The color of the background
colors -(str, str) or str.  A combined text/background color definition in a single parameter

There are also "aliases" for text_color, background_color and colors (t, b, c)
t - An alias for color of the text (makes for shorter calls)
b - An alias for the background_color parameter
c - (str, str) - "shorthand" way of specifying color. (foreground, backgrouned)
c - str - can also be a string of the format "foreground on background"  ("white on red")

With the aliases it's possible to write the same print but in more compact ways:
cprint('This will print white text on red background', c=('white', 'red'))
cprint('This will print white text on red background', c='white on red')
cprint('This will print white text on red background', text_color='white', background_color='red')
cprint('This will print white text on red background', t='white', b='red')

```
cprint(args=*<1 or N object>,
    end = None,
    sep = " ",
    text_color = None,
    font = None,
    t = None,
    background_color = None,
    b = None,
    colors = None,
    c = None,
    window = None,
    key = None,
    justification = None)
```

Show animation one frame at a time.  This function has its own internal clocking meaning you can call it at any frequency
 and the rate the frames of video is shown remains constant.  Maybe your frames update every 30 ms but your
 event loop is running every 10 ms.  You don't have to worry about delaying, just call it every time through the
 loop.

Displays a "notification window", usually in the bottom right corner of your display.  Has an icon, a title, and a message.  It is more like a "toaster" window than the normal popups.

The window will slowly fade in and out if desired.  Clicking on the window will cause it to move through the end the current "phase". For example, if the window was fading in and it was clicked, then it would immediately stop fading in and instead be fully visible.  It's a way for the user to quickly dismiss the window.

The return code specifies why the call is returning (e.g. did the user click the message to dismiss it)

```
popup_notify(args=*<1 or N object>,
    title = "",
    icon = ...,
    display_duration_in_ms = 3000,
    fade_in_duration = 1000,

    location = None)

## Popup Not PEP8 Compliant names

*** You should not use these function names! *** 

These versions of the popup functions are here only for backwards compatibility. Instead use the popup functions that have snake_case rather than CamelCase.

Popup - Display a popup Window with as many parms as you wish to include.  This is the GUI equivalent of the
"print" statement.  It's also great for "pausing" your program's flow until the user can read some error messages.

```
Popup(args=*<1 or N object>,
    title = None,
    button_color = None,
    background_color = None,
    text_color = None,
    button_type = 0,
    auto_close = False,
    auto_close_duration = None,
    custom_text = (None, None),
    non_blocking = False,
    icon = None,
    line_width = None,
    font = None,
    no_titlebar = False,
    grab_anywhere = False,
    keep_on_top = False,
    location = (None, None),
    any_key_closes = False,
    image = None,
    modal = True)

Show animation one frame at a time.  This function has its own internal clocking meaning you can call it at any frequency
 and the rate the frames of video is shown remains constant.  Maybe your frames update every 30 ms but your
 event loop is running every 10 ms.  You don't have to worry about delaying, just call it every time through the
 loop.

```

## PEP8 Function Bindings

## Display Objects In a Friendly Way

These functions will return an object as a string that shows each of the object's member variables.  They're nice to use if you want to print any Python object, not just PySimpleGUI ones.

Dumps an Object's values as a formatted string.  Very nicely done. Great way to display an object's member variables in human form

```
obj_to_string(obj, extra = "    ")
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| Any |  obj  | The object to display |
| str | extra | extra stuff (Default value = ' ') |
| (str) | **RETURN** | Formatted output of the object's values

Dumps an Object's values as a formatted string.  Very nicely done. Great way to display an object's member variables in human form
Returns only the top-most object's variables instead of drilling down to dispolay more

```
obj_to_string_single_obj(obj)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| Any | obj | The object to display |
| (str) | **RETURN** | Formatted output of the object's values

## The Main Program - Test Harness, Global Settings, Debug Information, Upgrade from GitHub

A convention that PySimpleGUI uses is that standalone entry points start with "main_".  These calls are essentially a mini-program within the PySimpleGUI.py file.

Used to get SDK help, test the installation, get information about the versions, upgrade from GitHub.

You can call main() from your code and then access these other features such as the global settings. You can also directly call these functions.

The PySimpleGUI "Test Harness".  This is meant to be a super-quick test of the Elements.

```
main()
```

Collect up and display the data needed to file GitHub issues.
This function will place the information on the clipboard.
You MUST paste the information from the clipboard prior to existing your application (except on Windows).

```
main_get_debug_data(suppress_popup = False)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| bool | suppress_popup | If True no popup window will be shown. The string will be only returned, not displayed |

```
main_global_pysimplegui_settings()
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (bool) | **RETURN** | True if settings were changed

Display a window that will display the docstrings for each PySimpleGUI Element and the Window object

## User Settings

In addition to user settings files, there is also a global PySimpleGUI settings file.

You can directly access the global settings through the UserSettings object: `pysimplegui_user_settings`

Returns the current settings dictionary.  If you've not setup the filename for the
settings, a default one will be used and then read.

```
user_settings()
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (dict) | **RETURN** | The current settings dictionary

Deletes an individual entry.  If no filename has been specified up to this point,

```
user_settings_delete_entry(key)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| Any | key | Setting to be saved. Can be any valid dictionary key type (hashable) |

Deltes the filename and path for your settings file.  Either paramter can be optional.
If you don't choose a path, one is provided for you that is OS specific
Windows path default = users/name/AppData/Local/PySimpleGUI/settings.
If you don't choose a filename, your application's filename + '.json' will be used
Also sets your current dictionary to a blank one.

```
user_settings_delete_filename(filename = None, path = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str | filename | The name of the file to use. Can be a full path and filename or just filename |
| str |   path   | The folder that the settings file will be stored in. Do not include the filename. |

Determines if a settings file exists.  If so a boolean True is returned.

If you don't choose a path, one is provided for you that is OS specific
Windows path default = users/name/AppData/Local/PySimpleGUI/settings.

If you don't choose a filename, your application's filename + '.json' will be used.

Normally the filename and path are split in the user_settings calls. However for this call they
can be combined so that the filename contains both the path and filename.

```
user_settings_filename(filename = None, path = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str | filename | The name of the file to use. Can be a full path and filename or just filename |
| str |   path   | The folder that the settings file will be stored in. Do not include the filename. |
| (str) | **RETURN** | The full pathname of the settings file that has both the path and filename combined.

Returns the value of a specified setting.  If the setting is not found in the settings dictionary, then
the user specified default value will be returned.  It no default is specified and nothing is found, then
None is returned.  If the key isn't in the dictionary, then it will be added and the settings file saved.
If no filename has been specified up to this point, then a default filename will be assigned and used.
The settings are SAVED prior to returning.

```
user_settings_get_entry(key, default = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|

| str |   path   | Path to the file. Defaults to a specific folder depending on the operating system |
| (dict) | **RETURN** | The settings dictionary (i.e. all settings)

Saves the current settings dictionary.  If a filename or path is specified in the call, then it will override any
previously specitfied filename to create a new settings file.  The settings dictionary is then saved to the newly defined file.

```
user_settings_save(filename = None, path = None)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str | filename | The fFilename to save to. Can specify a path or just the filename. If no filename specified, then the caller's filename will be used. |

## Clipboard APIs

Note that this clipboard uses tkinter's clipboard. There is a known limitation that your application needs to remain running until you've pasted the contents.  Managed to get around this limitation so that the clipboard stays set after you exit your application, but only have it working for Windows systems.

Gets the clipboard current value.

```
clipboard_get()
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| (str) | **RETURN** | The current value of the clipboard

Sets the clipboard to a specific value.
IMPORTANT NOTE - Your PySimpleGUI application needs to remain running until you've pasted
your clipboard. This is a tkinter limitation.  A workaround was found for Windows, but you still
need to stay running for Linux systems.

```
clipboard_set(new_value)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str | new_value | value to set the clipboard to. Will be converted to a string |

## Old Themes (Look and Feel) - Replaced by theme()

You should NOT use these calls.  They are here for your reference should you run into them in existing code.

Change the "color scheme" of all future PySimpleGUI Windows.
The scheme are string names that specify a group of colors. Background colors, text colors, button colors.
There are 13 different color settings that are changed at one time using a single call to ChangeLookAndFeel
The look and feel table itself has these indexes into the dictionary LOOK_AND_FEEL_TABLE.
The original list was (prior to a major rework and renaming)... these names still work...
In Nov 2019 a new Theme Formula was devised to make choosing a theme easier:
The "Formula" is:
["Dark" or "Light"] Color Number
Colors can be Blue Brown Grey Green Purple Red Teal Yellow Black
The number will vary for each pair. There are more DarkGrey entries than there are LightYellow for example.
Default = The default settings (only button color is different than system default)
Default1 = The full system default including the button (everything's gray... how sad... don't be all gray... please....)

```
ChangeLookAndFeel(index, force = False)
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| str  | index | the name of the index into the Look and Feel table (does not have to be exact, can be "fuzzy") |
| bool | force | no longer used |
| None | **RETURN** | None

Get a list of the valid values to pass into your call to change_look_and_feel

```
ListOfLookAndFeelValues()
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
| List[str] | **RETURN** | list of valid string values

Displays a "Quick Reference Window" showing all of the different Look and Feel settings that are available.
They are sorted alphabetically.  The legacy color names are mixed in, but otherwise they are sorted into Dark and Light halves

```
preview_all_look_and_feel_themes(columns = 12,
    scrollable = False,
    scroll_area_size = (None, None),
    search_string = None,
    location = (None, None))
```

Parameter Descriptions:

|Type|Name|Meaning|
|--|--|--|
|    int     |     columns      | The number of themes to display per row |
|    bool    |    scrollable    | If True then scrollbars will be added |
| (int, int) | scroll_area_size | Size of the scrollable area (The Column Element used to make scrollable) |
|    str     |  search_string   | If specified then only themes containing this string will be shown |
| (int, int) |     location     | Location on the screen to place the window. Defaults to the center like all windows |

Get a list of the valid values to pass into your call to change_look_and_feel

```
